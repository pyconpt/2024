### [**Platform Engineer**](https://pydantic.dev/about#join-the-teams){:target="\_blank"}
**Platform Engineer**
**Logfire**
As a Principal Platform Engineer you'll have the opportunity to take our nascent developer 
platform to the next level. You'll be the first full-time engineer dedicated to building out our 
internal developer platform and tooling, with the opportunity for you to build out a team as we
scale the company from <10 engineers.

### **What you will do:**
- Design and develop an internal developer platform to help our team move quicker 
from idea to production. Examples of features we want are test/preview 
environments, performant CI, strategies for running database migrations, etc.
-  Manage infrastructure maintenance like Postgres major version upgrades.
- Improve our infrastructure level security. For example by auditing IAM permissions or
implementing better intra-cluster RBAC.
- Grow a team that aligns with the company's vision and culture.

### **Who You Are**
We expect a candidate for this position to have experience in:
- Managing infrastructure via IaC
- Kubernetes.
- Database management (e.g. orchestrating migrations, deploying stateful services on 
k8s and managing data in test environments)
- GitHub and GitHub Actions, including complex workflows
- Experience with Google Cloud Platform


__Nice to haves but not required:__
- Experience as a team lead or manager
- Experience with Pulumi
- Familiarity with observability platforms, e.g. have deployed the OpenTelemetry Collector before.
- Experience with more than one of Python, Rust and TypeScript
- Experience with Postgres
- Familiarity with GKE
- A history of contributing to and working with Open Source Software

### **Some non-technical requirements:**
- Live and work in a timezone between PT (UTC-8) and CET (UTC+1)
- Able to travel to EU, UK and US up to 4 times a year to join our off-sites.

### **Our Tech Stack**
Our current stack consists of:
- Google Cloud Platform
- GitHub for version control
- Pulumi (TypeScript) for infrastructure as code (IaC)
- Google Kubernetes Engine (Autopilot) for compute
- Postgres / Google Cloud Storage (GCS) for data storage
- Redis for caching and buffering
- A mix of Rust and Python for backend services
- React (TypeScript) for our frontend

While we have a strong foundation we're getting to the point where the rate of new services, 
need for test environments, CI needs, etc. means we have to think more holistically about 
the experience of going from idea to production.

### **About Pydantic**
Pydantic is an open source data validation library for Python written in Rust, it's downloaded 
over 200M times a month and used by basically every company you've heard of.

Earlier this year I (the creator of Pydantic) decided to build developer tools with the same 
focus on developer experience that I think has made Pydantic successful.

We are currently building a next-generation observability platform built around 
OpenTelemetry, SQL as the query language and developer empathy as the driving force.

We're backed by Sequoia Capital and have long term runway.
Pydantic is a fully remote company with employees all over the world. We get together for 
offsites regularly - our next one is in September.


### **Apply**
Interested in shaping the user experience of observability with Pydantic? Send your resume, 
portfolio, and a brief cover letter to [careers@pydantic.dev](careers@pydantic.dev)

### [**Principal Developer**](https://pydantic.dev/about#join-the-teams){:target="\_blank"}
**Database Infrastructure - Rust**

### **The Job**
We are hiring a Rust developer to help design and implement the database infrastructure for 
our observability platform, [Pydantic Logfire](https://pydantic.dev/logfire).

### **Context**

Pydantic is an open source data validation library for Python, with core validation logic 
written in Rust. It's downloaded about 200M times a month and used by basically every 
company you've heard of. Last year we [started a company](https://pydantic.dev/articles/company-announcement) to build developer tools with the 
same focus on developer experience that I think has made Pydantic successful, backed by 
[Sequoia Capital](https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/partnering-with-pydantic-no-more-steel-seats-for-developers/).

At the beginning of May we launched [Logfire](https://pydantic.dev/logfire) into public Beta. Before we release it into 
general availability, we want our new database infrastructure (written in Rust and based on 
Apache Datafusion) to be rock solid. That's where you come in.

### **Advantages**

1. Greenfield project — the codebase of the application we're building is only a few 
months old
2. Lead — we want to hire someone opinionated and knowledgeable, who is excited to 
build database infrastructure that can scale to petabytes of data
3. Work with great people — Pydantic's widespread recognition means we've been 
lucky enough to hire some of the best Python and full stack developers in the world
4. Fully remote — we're a remote-first company, we get together in person roughly 
once a quarter for a week — our next "offsite" will be in France in the first week of 
5. Build developer tools — the observability space presents particularly interesting 
technical challenges, and building developer tools means that we get to be our own 
customers



### **Technical Requirements**
We're looking for (in descending order of importance):
1. Deep experience with Rust and its ecosystem
2. Experience with analytical/time-series database development and use — we're 
specifically looking for experience with the Apache Arrow ecosystem, and Apache 
DataFusion
3. Experience working with observability tools — experience working for an 
observability company, using observability platforms, and knowledge of 
OpenTelemetry would all be highly valuable
4. Experience working with Python would be a minor plus
More generally, you should care about performance, scalability, and developer experience, 
both within the team and for those using the tools we're building.

### **Non-technical Requirements**
1. **Required**: Live and work in a timezone between PT (UTC-8) and CET (UTC+1)
2. **Required**: Able to travel to EU, UK and US up to 4 times a year to join our off-sites
